# Assessing millenial-scale variability during the Holocone.

This folder contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the study from [Khider et al. (2014)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013PA002534).

The code is in the Jupyter Notebook entitled `Sea, Sun, and Python.ipynb` and is fully executable from Binder.

Two additional folders are provided:
* The data folder contains:
  * the original data for the study (namely, the MD98-2181 record in the [LiPD format](lipd.net) which can be seen [here](wiki.linked.earth)).
  * Intermediate outputs in JSON format from the spectral and wavelet analyses. Although the notebook is fully reproducible, it can take a few hours to run significance/chronological uncertainty. For convenience, we added these outputs so these cells can be skipped.

* The figure folder contains:
  * MD81_agemodel, which is Figure 2 from [Khider et al. (2014)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013PA002534).
  * MD81_ageoffset, which is Figure 3 from [Khider et al. (2014)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013PA002534).
